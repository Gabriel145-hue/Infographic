<h2>What is Volleyball?</h2>
<div class="definition-container">
<img src="volleyball-court.webp" alt="Volleyball Court">
<div>
<p><strong>Volleyball is a dynamic team sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net</strong>. The primary objective is to send the ball over the net, aiming to ground it on the opponent’s side of the court while preventing them from doing the same on your side.</p>
<p>The game is played with <strong>six players per team</strong>, and each player has a specific role to play. <strong>Volleyball requires teamwork, agility, and strategic thinking</strong> as players must communicate and work together to outsmart the opposing team. Whether it’s serving, passing, setting, or spiking, every move is part of a fast-paced strategy designed to score points and win sets.</p>

<h2>Steps to Execute Tricks</h2>
<p><strong>Serve:</strong> Stand behind the baseline with your feet shoulder-width apart. Focus on your target area in the opponent’s court. Toss the ball a few inches above your head with your non-dominant hand, then use your dominant hand to strike the ball cleanly with the heel of your palm or open hand. The goal is to send the ball over the net in a controlled manner, either with power (jump serve) or precision (float serve), aiming to make it difficult for the opposing team to return.</p>
<p><strong>Pass (Bump):</strong> Position yourself with your knees bent, feet slightly apart, and arms extended forward. When the ball approaches, use the platform created by your forearms to contact the ball. Avoid swinging your arms—let the ball bounce off the flat surface you've formed. The pass should be directed upward and slightly forward, ideally toward the setter, giving them the best opportunity to set the ball accurately.</p>
<p><strong>Set:</strong> Stand underneath the descending ball with your feet shoulder-width apart. Raise your hands above your forehead, forming a triangle shape with your thumbs and index fingers. Use the pads of your fingers—not your palms—to softly push the ball upward. The goal is to set the ball high and close to the net, positioning it perfectly for a teammate to execute a spike. Timing, precision, and gentle touch are crucial for an effective set.</p>
<p><strong>Spike:</strong> Begin with a few quick approach steps, then jump explosively toward the net. As you elevate, bring your hitting arm back and swing it forward forcefully to strike the ball with your palm at the highest point of your jump. Aim to drive the ball down into the opponent’s court with power and speed. A successful spike requires coordination, strength, and accurate targeting to bypass blockers and defenders.</p>
<p><strong>Block:</strong> Position yourself near the net with your hands up and eyes on the hitter. As the opposing player prepares to spike, jump straight up with both arms extended overhead. Keep your fingers spread wide and angle your hands slightly forward to direct the ball back into the opponent’s side. Timing your jump is key to a successful block—too early or too late and you’ll miss the opportunity to deflect the attack.</p>

<h2>History of Volleyball</h2>
<div class="history-container">
<div>
<p>
   Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, physical director of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was designed as an indoor sport for businessmen who found the new game of basketball too vigorous. Morgan called the sport “mintonette,” until a professor from Springfield College in Massachusetts noted the volleying nature of play and proposed the name of “volleyball.” The original rules were written by Morgan and printed in the first edition of the Official Handbook of the Athletic League of the Young Men’s Christian Associations of North America (1897). The game soon proved to have wide appeal for both sexes in schools, playgrounds, the armed forces, and other organizations in the United States, and it was subsequently introduced to other countries.
   In 1916 rules were issued jointly by the YMCA and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first nationwide tournament in the United States was conducted by the National YMCA Physical Education Committee in New York City in 1922. The United States Volleyball Association (USVBA) was formed in 1928 and recognized as the rules-making, governing body in the United States. From 1928 the USVBA—now known as USA Volleyball (USAV)—has conducted annual national men’s and senior men’s (age 35 and older) volleyball championships, except during 1944 and 1945. Its women’s division was started in 1949, and a senior women’s division (age 30 and older) was added in 1977. Other national events in the United States are conducted by member groups of the USAV such as the YMCA and the NCAA.
   Volleyball was introduced into Europe by American troops during World War I, when national organizations were formed. The Fédération Internationale de Volley Ball (FIVB) was organized in Paris in 1947 and moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1984. The USVBA was one of the 13 charter members of the FIVB, whose membership grew to more than 210 member countries by the late 20th century.
   International volleyball competition began in 1913 with the first Far East Games, in Manila. During the early 1900s and continuing until after World War II, volleyball in Asia was played on a larger court, with a lower net, and nine players on a team.</p>
